# Problem Statement
Because forex trading is more risky than investing in other forms, but returns are also very high.  
To reduce the risk, I thought the AI knowledge can fix this problem.  
I know that other investors have their own trading techniques and in this project I use basic techniques to help me train model.  
The goal of this system is to reduce risk and get profit by Automated trading.
